# Speech-Translation
# ABSTRACT
This project presents a comprehensive framework for direct speech-to-speech translation, employing a sophisticated pipeline integrating various modules to ensure accurate and fluent translation. At its core, the system utilizes a S2UT model, leveraging self-supervised learning techniques and k-means clustering to transform speech
signals into discrete units. Multitask learning enhances the modelâ€™s robustness by incorporating auxiliary tasks during training. Additionally, a unit-based vocoder, incorporating duration prediction, generates high-quality speech waveforms from the discrete units. Furthermore, a cascaded system approach integrates Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), Machine Translation (MT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) modules,
each contributing to the seamless translation process. The system design emphasizes
high-performance computing resources and large-scale datasets for training, with attention to network connectivity and memory capacity. Implementation and testing reveal
promising results, with evaluations based on BLEU and PESQ scores. Overall, this research advances the field of speech translation, offering a sophisticated framework for
real-world applications in multilingual communication.
